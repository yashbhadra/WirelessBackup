# WirelessBackup

This project is the implementation of a wireless backup service for android mobile phones. You can backup all of your mobile data onto your laptop with out connecting your phone with a 
cord. Just download and run a file server application onto your mobile phone and run this program on your laptop. After this, just sit back and let this program backup your entire 
mobile phone.
Note: You will have to change the constants like ip address and directory path and make sure that the laptop and phone are on the same wifi network.
