# WirelessBackup

This project introduces a wireless backup service for Android mobile phones, leveraging the concurrency features of the GO language such as go routines and channels. It enables users to back up their mobile data to their laptop without needing to connect via cords. By installing a file server application on the mobile phone and running the program on the laptop, users can effortlessly initiate and manage the backup process. 

Remember to adjust constants like IP address and directory paths to ensure both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network.
